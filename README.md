# stock-analysis
    Background: 
       Steve loves the workbook we prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although our code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.
      In this challenge, we’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, we’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we’ll present a written analysis that explains our findings.

Summary:
What are the advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code?
 Advantages:
•	By taking fewer steps, it can make the code more effective.
•	It can improve the flow of the code to make it easier for future developers to read
            and modify.
•	It may use less memory
Disadvantages:
•	It may be risky when the existing code doesn't have proper test cases to find 
    the bugs.
•	It may be risky when developers do not understand the original code and cannot 
    follow the flow of the code.
